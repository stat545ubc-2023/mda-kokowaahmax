---

This is the code repository for the mini data analysis assignment in STAT 545A, designed for each student with **Xin Wang** as the author. Within this repository, we store all the assignment questions, original code, and the output generated during the completion of the assignment.

To access the code, please follow these steps:

1. Clone or pull the main branch of the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with an R Kernel running.
3. Be prepared to run R Markdown files.

If you encounter errors during the knitting process due to missing libraries, follow the error messages' guidance to install the required libraries. Additionally, you can find information about the used libraries and instructions on how to install them near the first code chunk.

Upon completion, you will receive the output in _.md_ format, which is compatible with GitHub's representation of Markdown files.

If you have any questions, encounter errors, or wish to provide suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to contact the author by clicking on their GitHub avatar. Your feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you!
